# Digital-signal-processing-partial-sums-of-Fourier-series-in-Python

Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor.
# Task
 We need to take the functions and their corresponding Fourier series f and build their graphs using Python.
The number of terms is finite. We need to choose it so that the Fourier series is good enough
approximated the original function

# How to run the code ?
You just need to open Partial_sums_of_Fourier_series.ipynb in google colab notebook or jupiter notebook and run it
